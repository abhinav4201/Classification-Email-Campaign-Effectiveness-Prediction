Project Summary -
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can characterize and track emails sent through Gmail-based email marketing campaigns. This model will be used by small to medium business owners who are looking to improve the effectiveness of their email marketing efforts and increase customer retention.

One of the main challenges in email marketing is determining which emails are being read, ignored, or acknowledged by the reader. By understanding which emails are most effective at engaging the reader, business owners can tailor their marketing efforts and increase their chances of success.

To address this problem, we will gather data on a variety of email characteristics, including the subject line, sender name, email content, email format, and email frequency. We will also consider the target audience of the emails and any other relevant factors.

Using this data, we will train a machine learning model to predict whether an email is likely to be read, ignored, or acknowledged by the reader. This model will be able to analyze new emails and provide a prediction of how they are likely to be received by the reader.

To evaluate the performance of the model, we will split our data into a training set and a testing set. We will use the training set to fit the model and the testing set to evaluate its performance. We will use a variety of metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed in a production environment to help small to medium business owners improve the effectiveness of their email marketing campaigns. By using the model to characterize and track emails, they will be able to make more informed decisions about how to target their marketing efforts and increase customer retention.

Overall, this project aims to provide small to medium business owners with a powerful tool for improving the effectiveness of their email marketing campaigns. By using machine learning to characterize and track emails, they will be able to make more informed decisions and increase the chances of success for their marketing efforts.
